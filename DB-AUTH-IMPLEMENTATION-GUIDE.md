# KidPlay Arcade - Database Authentication Implementation

## Overview
This guide explains how to implement persistent user accounts and authentication in the KidPlay Arcade application by replacing in-memory storage with SQLite database storage.

## Implementation Files
We've created the following files:

1. `/backend/user-auth-routes.js` - Contains all user authentication endpoints with database support
2. `/backend/server-with-db-auth.js` - Updated server using the new auth routes
3. `/backend/test-db-auth.js` - Test script for the database implementation
4. `/setup-db-auth.sh` - Setup script to install dependencies and configure the application

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run the setup script to install required dependencies:
```
./setup-db-auth.sh
```

### Step 2: Run the Updated Server
Start the server with database authentication:
```
node backend/server-with-db-auth.js
```

### Step 3: Test the Implementation
Run the test script to verify all endpoints are working correctly:
```
./backend/test-db-auth.js
```

### Step 4: Deploy to AWS
Deploy the application to the target IP address (3.81.165.163):
```
./deploy-to-aws.sh
```

## Architecture Changes

### Database Service
- The DatabaseService (`/backend/services/DatabaseService.js`) provides all database operations
- User data is stored in SQLite tables with proper schemas
- JSON fields (preferences, game stats, etc.) are stored as serialized strings

### User Routes
- All user authentication endpoints use the DatabaseService
- Sessions remain in-memory but can be migrated to the database later
- Routes include:
  - `/api/user/register` - User registration
  - `/api/user/login` - User login
  - `/api/user/validate` - Token validation
  - `/api/user/profile` (GET) - Get user profile
  - `/api/user/profile` (PUT) - Update user profile
  - `/api/user/preferences` - Update user preferences
  - `/api/user/forgot-password` - Password reset
  - `/api/user/logout` - User logout

## Future Improvements
1. Store sessions in the database instead of in-memory
2. Implement email verification for new accounts
3. Complete password reset functionality with email delivery
4. Add refresh tokens for better security

## Deployment Notes
- The target IP address (3.81.165.163) is already configured in the deploy script
- Make sure environment variables are properly set in the server's ecosystem.config.js file
- The database file will be created at `/backend/kidplay_arcade.db`
