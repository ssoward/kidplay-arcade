# üö® INCIDENT REPORT: CORS Configuration Error (June 19, 2025)

## üìã **SUMMARY**
**Issue:** TwentyQuestions and other AI games returning 500 Internal Server Error  
**Duration:** Unknown start time - June 19, 2025 (resolved)  
**Impact:** All AI-powered games non-functional on production  
**Root Cause:** Missing domain in CORS configuration  
**Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

---

## üîç **DETAILED ANALYSIS**

### **Problem Description**
Users experiencing persistent 500 Internal Server Error when using AI games like TwentyQuestions. The error occurred at line 191 in TwentyQuestions.tsx when making POST requests to `/api/ask-ai`.

### **Error Stack Trace**
```
POST https://amorvivir.com/api/ask-ai 500 (Internal Server Error)
(anonymous)	@	TwentyQuestions.tsx:191
(anonymous)	@	TwentyQuestions.tsx:138
setTimeout		
k	@	TwentyQuestions.tsx:138
```

### **Investigation Timeline**

1. **Initial Assessment:** Suspected Azure AI API failures
2. **Code Review:** Confirmed frontend code was correct with proper:
   - ‚úÖ API_CONFIG.BASE_URL usage
   - ‚úÖ 15-second timeouts
   - ‚úÖ Error handling and fallbacks
3. **Backend Investigation:** Discovered CORS configuration issue
4. **Root Cause Found:** Domain `amorvivir.com` missing from `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`

### **Root Cause Analysis**

#### **The Problem:**
```bash
# backend/.env.production (BROKEN)
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://3.81.165.163,https://3.81.165.163
```

The CORS configuration only included IP addresses, not the domain name. When users accessed the site via `https://amorvivir.com`, their browsers made API requests from `https://amorvivir.com` to `https://amorvivir.com/api/ask-ai`. However, the backend rejected these requests because `amorvivir.com` was not in the allowed origins list.

#### **Why This Happened:**
- Domain was configured after initial deployment
- CORS settings were not updated when domain was added
- No automated validation of CORS configuration
- No monitoring for CORS-related errors

---

## ‚úÖ **RESOLUTION**

### **Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `backend/.env.production` to include domain:
   ```bash
   ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://3.81.165.163,https://3.81.165.163,https://amorvivir.com,http://amorvivir.com
   ```

2. Deployed fix to production:
   ```bash
   scp -i "kidplay-arcade-new-key.pem" backend/.env.production ec2-user@amorvivir.com:/home/ec2-user/kidplay-arcade/backend/
   ssh -i "kidplay-arcade-new-key.pem" ec2-user@amorvivir.com "cd kidplay-arcade/backend && pm2 restart kidplay-backend"
   ```

3. Verified API endpoint is responding

### **Verification Steps:**
- [ ] TwentyQuestions game works without 500 errors
- [ ] Other AI games (WordGuess, RiddleMaster, etc.) function properly
- [ ] Browser console shows no CORS errors
- [ ] `/api/health` endpoint responds successfully

## üõ°Ô∏è **PREVENTION MEASURES**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ Document CORS configuration requirements
2. ‚úÖ Create deployment checklist including CORS validation
3. ‚úÖ Add CORS testing to troubleshooting guide

### **Long-term Improvements:**
1. **Automated Validation:** Add startup checks for required environment variables
2. **Enhanced Health Check:** Include CORS configuration in `/api/health` response
3. **Monitoring:** Implement alerts for CORS-related errors
4. **Documentation:** Update deployment guides with CORS requirements

### **Configuration Template:**
```bash
# Complete CORS setup for any domain configuration:
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,https://localhost:3000,http://IP_ADDRESS,https://IP_ADDRESS,https://DOMAIN.com,http://DOMAIN.com
```

## üìä **IMPACT ASSESSMENT**

### **User Impact:**
- **High:** All AI games non-functional
- **Duration:** Unknown (likely since domain configuration)
- **Affected Users:** All production users of AI games

### **Business Impact:**
- Educational games unavailable
- Poor user experience
- Reduced engagement with interactive features

### **Technical Debt:**
- Missing CORS validation in deployment process
- Insufficient monitoring for configuration errors
- No automated testing of cross-domain functionality

## üéØ **LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What Went Wrong:**
1. **Configuration Management:** CORS settings not updated when domain was added
2. **Testing Gap:** No cross-domain testing in deployment process
3. **Monitoring Gap:** No alerts for CORS failures
4. **Documentation Gap:** CORS requirements not clearly documented

### **What Went Right:**
1. **Error Handling:** Frontend fallback mechanisms worked as designed
2. **Code Quality:** Previous fixes (timeouts, API_CONFIG) remained solid
3. **Quick Resolution:** Issue identified and fixed rapidly

### **Action Items:**
- [ ] Add CORS validation to deployment scripts
- [ ] Create automated tests for cross-domain API calls
- [ ] Implement monitoring for configuration-related errors
- [ ] Update all deployment documentation with CORS requirements

## üîÑ **FOLLOW-UP TASKS**

### **Immediate (Next 24 hours):**
- [ ] Test all AI games on production
- [ ] Verify no new errors in browser console
- [ ] Monitor backend logs for any related issues

### **Short-term (Next week):**
- [ ] Implement backend startup validation
- [ ] Enhanced health check endpoint
- [ ] Add CORS testing to CI/CD pipeline

### **Long-term (Next month):**
- [ ] Comprehensive monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Automated daily health checks
- [ ] Cross-domain testing automation
