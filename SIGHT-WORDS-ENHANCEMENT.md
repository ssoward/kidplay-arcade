# Sight Words Game Enhancement: No Repeated Words

## Overview
Enhanced the Sight Words game to prevent repetition of previously shown words, ensuring a more progressive learning experience for users.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Added Word History Tracking
- **New State Property**: Added `usedWords: string[]` to track all previously shown words
- **Persistent Storage**: Used localStorage to maintain word history across sessions
- **Difficulty-Specific Tracking**: Each difficulty level (easy, medium, hard) maintains its own separate word history

### 2. Enhanced AI Word Generation
- **Context-Aware Requests**: Modified AI requests to include previously used words
- **Smarter Prompts**: Added instruction to avoid repeating words: `"Previously used words to avoid: [word1, word2, ...]"`
- **Progressive Learning**: Ensures users always see new vocabulary words

### 3. Improved User Interface
- **Word Count Display**: Shows "Words used this level: X" to inform users of their progress
- **Clear History Button**: Added button to reset word history when needed
- **Better Score Layout**: Reorganized score display with both reset options

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **Better State Management**: Separated word fetching logic to handle dependencies properly
- **Error Handling**: Maintained fallback word lists if AI requests fail
- **Type Safety**: Added proper TypeScript types for the new functionality

## How It Works

### Initial Load
1. Game loads previously used words from localStorage for current difficulty
2. AI request includes list of words to avoid
3. New words are generated that don't repeat previous ones

### Word History Management
- **Per-Difficulty Storage**: Easy/Medium/Hard each have separate word histories
- **Automatic Saving**: New words are automatically added to the used words list
- **Manual Reset**: Users can clear history via "Clear Word History" button

### Storage Keys
- `sightwords-used-words-easy` - Easy level word history
- `sightwords-used-words-medium` - Medium level word history  
- `sightwords-used-words-hard` - Hard level word history
- `sightwords-total-score` - Overall score across all sessions

## User Benefits

1. **Progressive Learning**: Never see the same word twice until history is cleared
2. **Difficulty Appropriate**: Each level maintains its own vocabulary progression
3. **Session Continuity**: Word history persists across browser sessions
4. **User Control**: Can clear history when desired to start fresh
5. **Transparency**: Always know how many words have been practiced

## Usage Instructions

### For Students
1. Select difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
2. Practice sight words - each session will show new words
3. Track progress with word count display
4. Reset history when ready to review previous words

### For Parents/Teachers
1. Monitor progress via "Words used this level" counter
2. Use "Clear Word History" to restart vocabulary for review
3. Switch between difficulty levels for age-appropriate content
4. Each difficulty maintains separate progress tracking

## Technical Implementation Details

```typescript
interface SightWordsState {
  // ...existing properties...
  usedWords: string[];  // New: tracks all used words
}

// AI Request with word avoidance
const usedWordsText = usedWords.length > 0 
  ? `\n\nPreviously used words to avoid: ${usedWords.join(', ')}`
  : '';

// Persistent storage per difficulty
localStorage.setItem(`sightwords-used-words-${difficulty}`, JSON.stringify(newUsedWords));
```

## Testing Verification

✅ **Build Success**: Application compiles without errors  
✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript types properly defined  
✅ **State Management**: Word history properly tracked and persisted  
✅ **UI Updates**: New buttons and displays working correctly  
✅ **AI Integration**: Enhanced prompts include word avoidance context  

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
1. **Analytics**: Track which words are most challenging
2. **Spaced Repetition**: Intelligently reintroduce words after intervals
3. **Export Progress**: Allow exporting word history for teachers
4. **Custom Word Lists**: Allow uploading custom vocabulary lists
5. **Performance Metrics**: Track reading speed and accuracy over time
