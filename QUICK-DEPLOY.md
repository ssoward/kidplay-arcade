# Quick Deployment Commands for AWS EC2

## Copy and paste these commands on your EC2 instance:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory and pull latest changes
cd kidplay-arcade && git pull origin main

# Run the deployment script
./deploy-aws-ec2.sh
```

## If this is the first deployment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ssoward/kidplay-arcade.git
cd kidplay-arcade

# Run the deployment script
chmod +x deploy-aws-ec2.sh
./deploy-aws-ec2.sh
```

## What the deployment script does:

1. âœ… Updates system packages
2. âœ… Installs Node.js and npm
3. âœ… Installs project dependencies
4. âœ… Builds the React production version
5. âœ… Installs and configures PM2 process manager
6. âœ… Starts the backend server on port 3001
7. âœ… Configures nginx to serve the frontend and proxy API calls
8. âœ… Sets up SSL with Let's Encrypt (if domain is configured)

## After deployment:

- **Frontend**: Available at http://your-ec2-ip or https://your-domain.com
- **Backend API**: Available at http://your-ec2-ip:3001/api or proxied through nginx
- **Process Management**: `pm2 status` to check running processes

## Troubleshooting:

- Check logs: `pm2 logs`
- Restart services: `pm2 restart all`
- Check nginx: `sudo systemctl status nginx`
- View nginx logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`
