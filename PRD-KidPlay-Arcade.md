## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Users table
CREATE TABLE users (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  display_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  avatar_url TEXT,
  preferences JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  last_active TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Game sessions table
CREATE TABLE game_sessions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  game_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  score INTEGER,
  duration_seconds INTEGER,
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  metadata JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Achievements table
CREATE TABLE achievements (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  achievement_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  earned_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  metadata JSONB
);
```

### API Architecture
```typescript
// Game service interface
interface GameService {
  createSession(gameType: string, userId?: string): Promise<GameSession>;
  updateSession(sessionId: string, score: number, metadata: any): Promise<void>;
  getLeaderboard(gameType: string, timeframe: string): Promise<LeaderboardEntry[]>;
  getUserStats(userId: string): Promise<UserGameStats>;
}

// AI service interface
interface AIService {
  generateStory(prompt: string, context: StoryContext): Promise<string>;
  interpretDream(dreamText: string, userAge: number): Promise<DreamInterpretation>;
  createRiddle(difficulty: Difficulty): Promise<Riddle>;
  analyzeArtwork(artworkId: string): Promise<ArtworkAnalysis>;
}
```

### Security Considerations
- **Input Validation:** All user inputs validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints protected against abuse
- **Content Filtering:** AI responses filtered for inappropriate content
- **Data Privacy:** COPPA compliance for children's data
- **Secure Authentication:** JWT tokens with proper expiration
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** All communications encrypted in transit

### Performance Optimization
- **Code Splitting:** Dynamic imports for game components
- **Image Optimization:** WebP format with fallbacks
- **Caching Strategy:** Browser and CDN caching for static assets
- **Database Indexing:** Optimized queries for user data
- **API Optimization:** Response compression and pagination
